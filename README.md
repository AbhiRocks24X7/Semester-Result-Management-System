Project Title:- CGPA Calculation System for College Students
This project is to develop a system to figure out CGPA for college students, facilitating monitoring of academic progress for both students and teachers. This system makes ti simple to check student's progress and create results with ease.

Language Used:- C++ Features:

• User Input of total number of subjects, marks, Current Semester and credits for each subject.
• Conversion of marks to grade points (GP) using a predefined grading system.
• Calculation of Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) based on marks and credits.
• Calculation of Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on SGPA of all semesters.
• Displaying the result indicating CGPA and performance status. Function: marksToPointerConvert
• Convertion of marks obtained ni each subject to grade points based on a predefined grading system.


Grade points are calculated using a conversion table mapping marks to grade points.
Function: calculateSGPA
• Calculation of Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) based on the
 formula:
        SGPA =(E(Credits *Grade Points)) / Total Credits
        
Function: calculateCGPA
• Calculation of Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on SGPA of all semesters.
• CGPA is computed by taking the weighted average of all SGPA values.
Function: displayResult
• Displaying the result including CGPA and performance status. • Performance status includes Grade A,B,C, etc.

In the near future, this System can be integrated with existing Student portals allowing students to access their academic records conveniently. By automating the calculation process, the system reduces the time and effort required to generate results.
